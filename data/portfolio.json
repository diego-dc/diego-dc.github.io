      "description": "This project started as a personal challenge to dive into technologies I wasnâ€™t very familiar with yet, as well as explore others that piqued my interest. It allowed me to create something personal where I could apply and showcase my skills. The main focus of this project was to experiment with new techniques, try out animations, and blend my creative abilities with my technical skills. The idea is to keep developing the site, making changes or experimenting with styles as I learn more. It's a blank canvas that I intend to fully explore, applying things that interest me and creating something eye-catching to showcase to others!",

      "description": "I led the development of the website for the 'Feria Laboral' organized by Redes Beauchef, tackling the challenge of creating the platform within a very limited timeframe. The platform enabled over 300 job offers to be published and facilitated more than 5,000 applications, playing a crucial role in the event's success. This project was a significant challenge, as I participated in every stage, from evaluating its feasibility to launching it in production and maintaining it during the event. I took on the role of a key developer, working on various aspects, including designing the data model and database structure, implementing user management and ensuring robust security measures, developing the application's UI/UX and multiple views, and creating and managing forms for efficient user interaction. The platform was built with a focus on scalability and adaptability, ensuring its continued use in future editions of the Feria Laboral. Today, the platform remains an integral tool for the Beauchef campus job fairs.",

      "description": "This project involved developing the gameplay mechanics for a video game in its early stages of development. The game, called 'Zombattan', is set in a post-apocalyptic world and is centered around survival mode. My primary responsibilities included researching and designing the core gameplay mechanics that would support the overall gameplay experience, developing these mechanics, and creating a test map for conducting a small study. This study served as a proof of concept to validate the mechanics and provided clear guidance for the next phase of development.",
